# 9-11-The-Game-The-Flight-93-Demo
In Unreal Engine 4, build a vertical slice of a video game experience centering on the event of Flight 93 that is supposed to have crashed in a field in Pennsylvania.  This Demo is to be either transitioned to an open source engine like GODOT, or the accompanying full game development completely finished in Unreal Engine 4.  There will be three modes.  The Official Story, The Unofficial Story, and a multiplayer mode based in each set piece where a player spawns into one of numerous formerly NPC avatars which will represent real life counterparts in most MP set pieces.
